							Andrew turned 21 in January. His party was celebrated with family and friends in his family home, showered in chocolates, celebratory drinks and happy faces posing for group photos. The night was filled with drunken laughter and happy wishes.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Andrew’s funeral was on the 3rd of July, that same happy crowd saying their goodbyes. This is the tragic situation amongst many New Zealanders of today, with it only becoming more frequent; no voice, no help, nowhere to turn. For someone who had quietly suffered for years, he was failed by the system that promised to help him.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							There were over 20 Andrews for every 100,000 young adults last year.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							One thing is made clear by these statistics: New Zealand needs change. Among the countless news articles and voices speaking out, three main questions need to be addressed.
							</p>
							
							<p>
							How bad is it?
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Have we made any progress?
							</p>
							
							
							What’s in store for our youth to come?

							Kerry Gibson, a lecturer at The University of Auckland, has closely studied youth mental health worldwide. She regularly encounters New Zealand’s mental healthcare system, which she describes as “overwhelmed” and “outdated.”

							</p>
							
							<p>
							“Every now and again, somebody will phone and ask me for help on how to negotiate the system. And a lot of the time I'm stumped.”
							</p>
							
							<p>
							Gibson is a clinical psychologist specializing in youth mental health, along with being known as the former President of the New Zealand Psychological Society.

							“How we expect a young person in a state of distress to negotiate all of that complexity?”

							There have been large amounts of the government’s finances put towards fixing these statistics in the last few years. $1.9 billion dollars in 2019, and <a href="https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/political/521273/new-targets-set-to-mental-health-sector-as-10m-fund-opens">$10 million in 2024</a>
. With no visible improvements to the workings of Aotearoa New Zealand, many cases continue to <a href="https://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/man-who-died-of-suspected-suicide-had-fought-dhb-for-care-plan-lack-of-documentation-criticised/HAV47ISV3ZBR5MB5IUCDOONOZM/">fall through the cracks in the system</a>

							<p>The 1990s saw important advances in the mental health services offered around New Zealand, though the biggest changes date back to 1973. Deinstitutionalization began in the country following a demand for outpatient care, with the mentally ill becoming more embraced by the wider public.
							
							</p>
							
							<p>Institutionalization saw hundreds of people across the world being locked into institutional facilities with horrific quality of care. 1846 was when “Lunatic Ordinance” had anyone deemed a “lunatic” by two doctors and a magistrate put into prisons or hospitals. Though when those got overcrowded, asylums were built.

							</p>
							
							<p>Johnny Matteson, a musician and mental health worker from New Zealand, needed support at a time when Aotearoa New Zealand didn’t openly accept mental illness. Instead of getting the help he needed, “It all just happened so quickly”, and he was admitted to Carrington Psychiatric Hospital.

							</p>
							
							<p>“I was there for six months – it was extremely traumatic and changed the rest of my life.”

							</p>
							
							<p>Mental Health Foundation of NZ has shared <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://mentalhealth.org.nz/stories/story/johnnys-story&sa=D&source=docs&ust=1730428569528788&usg=AOvVaw3og2KHEGLvzrOxkp_KAFnt">Johnny’s story</a> from his time as a 19-year-old in misplaced ‘healthcare’.

							</p>
							
							<p>Gibson, despite studying current-day mental health, acknowledges that “our systems are very much based on people who think in a very linear kind of way,”

							</p>
							
							<p>Beyond the extremities of institutionalization, there were fewer platforms to advertise mental health services or access hotline services. <a href="https://mentalhealth.inquiry.govt.nz/inquiry-report/he-ara-oranga/chapter-1-the-inquiry/1-4-context/">In the past 10 years </a>
							alongside the growth of technology, 73% more people are accessing mental health and addiction services.

						High School has statistically proven itself to be a mentally challenging moment for many New Zealand youth, with <a href="https://mentalhealth.org.nz/statistics-on-schools-and-youth-mental-health"> a quarter </a>of students experiencing very high levels of psychological distress.

						</p>
						
						<p>
						Mast confirms this, describing her high school end of year exam atmosphere as “strange” and “daunting”.

						</p>
						
						<p>
						“It feels so uncertain knowing whether what I have studied or how I have studied will pay off, and I just worry that it won't be enough.”

						</p>
						
						<p>
						A September 2024 Youthline <a href="https://youthline.co.nz/exams-got-you-stressed/">survey</a> saw 55% of 15–24-year-olds in New Zealand agreeing with Kudrat, saying that stress was their biggest issue within their lives- particularly exams, study and homework.

						“There is so much left to do,”

						As excited as she is for university next year, she’s equally daunted for the big new step.

							Technology has proven itself to be far more influential than ever seen possible, with advancements progressing even in the mental health sector. Gibson comments on the dangers of social media, but also highlights that technology “also offers a space to connect for lots of people, it can be quite a creative space”. She also points out that there is no conclusive result for whether social media causes more mental distress or helps people to stay connected to each other and access mental health support.

							The Ministry's first published Suicide Prevention Action Plan in 2019 is on the Ministry of Health's website, setting a 10-year strategy divided into 5-year intervals. This mental health plan focuses on long-term goals, specific outcomes, key priorities, and shared responsibility to create a brighter future. With the current 5-year phase ending soon, the Ministry has opened a public consultation to update the plan, which will close on November 1.

							Kear speaks of the silence that surrounds the word “suicide” with curiosity.

							“The more people speaking up about their own mental health, the more normal it becomes among them to seek help. Suicide, on the other hand, is like this word that must never get mentioned.”
